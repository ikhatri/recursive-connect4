#recursive-connect4
###An implementation of the connect 4 board game that uses recusion to check for diagonal victories... Just 'cause?

Disclaimer: I made this over 2 years ago and I'm pretty sure it works, but it's entirely possible that it's broken and I just don't know about it. Feel free to drop a pull request if you notice any improvements!
